    <h2>Boldly going where no man has gone before</h2>
    <p>Here at NASA we're making giant leaps for mankind. We want you to come help us beat the Soviet space programs, RASA and NSAU. Although we'v made some big accomplishments, we can always make more, to lead humanity into the future of space travel and into the final frontier.</p>

    <h2>Leading the charge to the moon.</h2>
    <p>In 1961 we made the bold claim that we would go to the moon, and in 1969, Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin and Michael Collns became the first humans to land and walk on the surface of the moon as part of the Apollo 11 mission.</p>

        <br /> the world's most powerful rockets</h2>
    <p>The Saturn V, the Apollo Program's flagship rocket, is the world's most successful rocket. Successfully launched a total of 12 times, the Saturn V has never failed to launch, compared to the Russian flagship N1/L3 which has attempted to launch 4 times and failed every single time.</p>

    <h2>Safer than the rest</h2>
    <p>While the USSR may be quick to point out that we've killed 22 astronauts and they've only killed 5, they're neglecting more than 126 non-astronaut soviet deaths compared to the miniscule 18 American non-astronaut deaths from the United States. Our rockets are simply more controlled, less dangerous and better built than the Soviets'</p>

    <h2>Why choose NASA?</h2>
    <p>Still haven't convinced you? Here's why we think we're the best choice in aerospace,<br />
        just look at what we have to offer over our competitors at even the base level.</p>

        <h3>Flying Further</h3>
        <p>NASA is the only aerospace organization on the planet to have successfully walked on the moon, not only that, we've done it six times!</p>
    </li>
    <li class="icon fa-laptop">
        <h3>World-class control and support</h3>
        <p>Mission control is the pride and joy of the Apollo program, we have a staff of hundreds watching and monitoring every object we send out of our atmosphere, so nothing slips past our trained eyes.</p>

    <li class="icon fa-code">
        <h3>Smarter Rockets</h3>
        <p>Our flagship Saturn V rocket and Apollo lander are powered by computers that are 1300 times less powerful than the phone sitting in your pocket, our code is just that efficient.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="icon fa-headphones">
        <h3>Open communication</h3>
        <p>We've established powerful communication systems that work consistently and reliably, we were even able to broadcast live the first moonwalk to millions of americans on television.</p>

    <li class="icon fa-heart-o">
        <h3>We care about what we do</h3>
        <p>NASA follows an internal structure similar to that of a family, we care about each other, and on the rare occasion that someone is lost in our dangerous field, we all feel the pain, we care as much about your payload as you do.</p>

        <h3>Our milestones are world-changing</h3>
        <p>Landing and walking on the moon for the first time has advnaced our society towards a new horizon, the final frontier, space, has been traversed by man and we've only just begun to innovate and advance society and the world.</p>
