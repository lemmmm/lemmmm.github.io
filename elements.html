<h5>John F. Kennedy</h5>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>The 35th president of the United States. Made the bold claim that the United States would get a man on the moon before 1970, which he was correct about, but unfortunately, did not live to see, as he was assassinated in 1963. Famously said <blockquote> We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.</blockquote></p>
