<h3>How did we come about?</h3>
<p>In 1958, Explorer I, designed by the United States Military was launched under the direction of famed rocket scientist Wernher von Braun. This was the start of the organization known today as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which would be created later that year by President Dwight Eisenhower. The signed public order created an administration that was dedicated to space exploration.</p>
<p>Eisenhower simultaneously created two security-oriented space programs in addition to the exploration-oriented NASA. The first of these programs was controlled and operated by the United States Air Force, this program would dedicate itself to exploring the military potential of space. The seconded security-oriented program was led by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), this program was known under the code-name Corona; its focus was to use orbiting satellites to gather information on the USSR and other communist powers such as China.   </p>

<h4>The Race</h4>
<p>In 1959, the Soviet space program (RASA/NSAU) made a jump in progress when they launched the Luna 2, a space probe designed to hit the moon as a proof-of-concept. In April 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first person to orbit Earth, which is defined as following a spheroidal path around the planet without being pulled back down into the atmosphere by the Earth's gravity. Traveling in the capsule-like spacecraft Vostok 1, Gagarin made one full orbit of the earth over the course of 108 minutes, reaching a maximum height of 327 kilometers. This however, was not a major loss for the United States. Project Mercury, the first efforts of the United States to send a human into space involved new NASA engineers designing a smaller, cone-shaped capsule far lighter than the soviet Vostok; it was tested with chimpanzees and then with a human in 1961, and a month before Yuri Gagarin was launched, the final test flight of Project Mercury was held and Project Mercury was deemed safe for a huamn crew. Later that year, Alan Shepard became the first American in space.</p>
<p>That same month, riding on the success of Project Mercury, President John F. Kennedy made a public announcement that the United States would land a man on the moon before 1970. This new milestone sounded bold to most and was partially ignored, however, on July 20th, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first human to walk on the surface of the moon, deeming the historic moment 

<blockquote>one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind</blockquote>

Through this accomplishment, the United States effectively "won" the space race that began in 1957 with the soviet launch of the Sputnik space craft. The Soviet Union never landed on the moon, despite four failed attempts to launch a lunar lander, one of which would lead to a swathe of soviet deaths and a brilliant explosion.
